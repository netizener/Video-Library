# Video-Library
> A very old, rudimentary, JDBC Project I created for SSC curriculum, *my first programming project!* ðŸ˜Ž

### Pre-requisite Software
* Working MySQL 5.7 installation
* OracleJDK 8 (JDK 8)
* Netbeans IDE (to build the project)

### How to use this?
**If you want to use this, please don't.** 
Its very rudimentary, and I am just putting this up on GitHub only for *archival purposes* (and it also has some fun memories attached to it), since it was my first ever programming project. However, if you still want to use it, here are the steps (**you have been warned!**) : 
* Clone this repository
* Fire up MySQL 5.7 server command line window and paste the boilerplate code in Database.txt
* Build the Video_Library project in Netbeans IDE
* Watch your computer get blown to bits (jk)

### Built with
* Netbeans IDE
* OracleJDK 8
* MySQL 5.7
* Java Swing
